# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains exercises, examples and notes on my learning process during the completion of the specialization program **Data Structures and Algorithms**. This is given by the UC San Diego. It consists on the following courses:

1. Algorithmic Toolbox
1. Data Structures
1. Algorithms on Graphs
1. Algorithms on Strings
1. Complexity
1. Genome Assembly Programming Challenge

I separate each course on a directory. Each directory will contain a log, where all my thoughts and insights will be written, and subdirectories that contain each week's assignments.

The preferred languages for this repo are **Python** and **JavaScript**. To strengthen my abilities on the former language, I will follow Sammie Bae's book **JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms**.
